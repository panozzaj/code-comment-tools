Rules / ideas
C-like only (C, C++, Java, C#)
 For lines stripped of whitespace at the end,
  Check for lines ending with end-line delimiter
  Check for language keywords or syntax types
  Check for comments that have other comments embedded in them
  Check for functions that exist in the code

Might want an option or something that detects that something is a print statement that is often useful for debugging certain sections.  Not clear that this will be useful, so not writing up quite yet.

Lookahead/lookbehind to see if there are comments above/behind that are describing this commented out code (could just be done by human diffing for now)
 In general we need more context to do more interesting things
 Comments of a feather flock together

Would be nice to use pretty command-line usage, etc. tool


When multiple languages supported:
File type detection
